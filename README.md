# Decision_Tree(CART)
A decision tree is one of most frequently and widely used supervised machine learning algorithms that can perform both regression and classification tasks. Hence called CART - Classification And Regression Trees.

For each attribute in the dataset, the decision tree algorithm forms a node, where the most important attribute is placed at the root node. For evaluation we start at the root node and work our way down the tree by following the corresponding node that meets our condition or "decision". This process continues until a leaf node is reached, which contains the prediction or the outcome of the decision tree.
